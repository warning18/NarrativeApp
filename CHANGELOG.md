# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here, generated from the
repository's pull-request history (each entry corresponds to one merged PR
and the version it bumped `pubspec.yaml` to). Format loosely follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).

History before v1.23.1 predates per-PR versioning in this repository and
isn't reconstructable from git history alone.

## [1.53.0+80]

### Fixed
- The Playthrough Simulator's gold model never paid out a won fight's `goldReward` — it counted the encounter but only ever applied the choice's own (usually zero) `goldMod`. Since most of the story's gold comes from combat rather than flat pickups, every "random strategy" batch reliably ended near 0 gold despite visiting working shops, which is exactly the "can't participate in the economy" pattern a Gemini analysis of simulator batches flagged. Combat gold now folds into the step's recorded `goldMod` so the chapter breakdown and CSV/JSON exports stay consistent with the run's final total. The "maximize gold" strategy also now accounts for a fight's payout when scoring choices, instead of only ever chasing flat `goldMod` bonuses.
- Node 260's "Refuse & Fight" carried a -1 alignment penalty despite being the only reachable choice for any player without the 50 gold node 261 requires to pay the toll instead — i.e. a guaranteed alignment hit for self-defense with no real alternative this early in the story. Removed.

### Added
- A real fork at the Hollow Court altar (node 5003): fighting the zealots outright (`hollow_court_zealot`) is now an alternative to letting them scatter, leading to its own aftermath beat before rejoining the main path.
- A climax guardian fight at the Void tear (node 6003/6003b): a `void_manifestation` now contests the crossing into Chapter 5's final scene instead of it being an unopposed walk-through.
- Two new enemies (`hollow_court_zealot`, `void_manifestation`) extending the existing difficulty curve past the previous `inquisition_high_warden` ceiling, so Chapters 4 and 5 — previously zero combat encounters between them — have real stakes at the story's climax.

A random-walk simulation against the story graph (ignoring gating, matching the in-app simulator's own model) confirms the intended effect: average final gold across 3000 simulated runs goes from 86 to 217 with the zero-gold outcome eliminated entirely (was 1.6% of runs even before this fix, would have been ~75% without any combat payout at all), and average final alignment improves from -0.97 to -0.48.

Chapter 3-5 branching still falls well short of Chapter 1's — closing that gap properly is a larger, multi-release content project rather than something to rush into one PR alongside a balance/bug-fix pass.

## [1.52.1+79]

### Fixed
- Collapsing the story view's status bar left a large blank band instead of actually reclaiming the space (an `Expanded(child: statusBarCollapsed ? SizedBox.shrink() : ...)` inside a `Row` kept the row's own height and the Expanded's claimed width regardless of the collapsed state). Restructured so collapsed shows nothing but the small toggle itself.

### Changed
- Quest/item/skill/dice detail dialogs now render their flavor-text description with larger text and more generous line spacing, matching how the main story narration is styled, instead of the dialog's cramped default text style.


### Added
- Copy button for the Playthrough Simulator's batch summary (previously only individual runs and the Gemini analysis could be copied — batches only had Export).
- CSV and JSON export options for a batch's results, alongside the existing plain-text transcript export — CSV as one row per run (ending, gold, alignment, nodes visited, combat encounters, etc.) ready to drop into a spreadsheet, JSON as the same per-run data structured for scripting.

## [1.51.1+77]

### Added
- A `secret-scan` job in CI (using [gitleaks](https://github.com/gitleaks/gitleaks)) that runs before every build and gates the whole pipeline: if an API key, token, or other credential is ever committed, the push or PR fails before anything is built or released. Verified against the full existing codebase and git history first — both clean.

## [1.51.0+76]

### Added
- Copy button next to "Analyze with Gemini" in the Playthrough Simulator, matching the Copy/Export actions individual run transcripts already had.

### Fixed
- Playthrough Simulator results were lost every time the screen was backed out of and reopened (it's reached via `Navigator.push`, so a fresh widget instance means fresh, empty state) — moved the batch list into a Riverpod provider that lives for the app's lifetime, so results now persist until explicitly cleared with the app bar's clear-all button.
- Settings > Check for Updates always failed silently: this repository is private, and both the release lookup and the APK download were unauthenticated GitHub API calls, which a private repo answers with a 404 indistinguishable from a generic network failure. Both now send the GitHub Personal Access Token already stored for GitHub Sync (the download goes through GitHub's authenticated release-asset API instead of the plain, sign-in-walled `browser_download_url`), and tapping "Check for Updates" with no token set shows a specific message pointing at where to add one instead of a generic failure.

### Changed
- The Playthrough Simulator's strategy/runs controls now also collapse the moment the player scrolls down into the results (previously they only auto-collapsed right after running a batch, and only re-expanded on scrolling back to the top).
- The story view's status bar and companion strip now collapse automatically once the player scrolls down into a long piece of narration, instead of only ever collapsing via their manual chevron toggles.

## [1.50.0+75]

### Added
- Structural graph-integrity checker (`lib/data/story_graph_integrity.dart`) that walks every choice from the start node, ignoring gold/alignment/flag gating, to find unreachable nodes, dead ends, and broken `next_id` links — codifying the exhaustive BFS this project had been running by hand after content passes.
- "Audit Graph Structure" button in the Playthrough Simulator that runs the same check and reports results in-app.
- Automated test suite (`test/story_graph_integrity_test.dart`) that runs the structural audit against the shipped story graph on every CI run.
- A real smoke test (`test/widget_test.dart`) that launches the actual app and checks it renders, replacing the leftover default Flutter counter-app test.
- `flutter analyze` and `flutter test` steps in CI, and a `pull_request` trigger so both run before merge instead of only after pushing to `main`.
- `CHANGELOG.md` (this file).
- A guaranteed encounter for the previously-unused `void_wisp` enemy and its "Void Relic" quest, added to node 3005 alongside the chapter's other optional side-fights.

### Changed
- Node 3005's four side-fights now hint at their relative danger in their choice text (previously identical HP-blind phrasing spanned 74-182 HP with no in-fiction signal).
- Bumped the `gemini-1.5-flash` calls in the AI story generator and the simulator's Gemini analysis to `gemini-2.5-flash`, matching the model generation already used for Gemini TTS.

### Removed
- Seven dead root-level prototype files (`main.dart`, `models.dart`, `game_provider.dart`, `editor_tab.dart`, `play_tab.dart`, `schema_tab.dart`, `theme.dart`) superseded by `lib/` since the project's earliest commits and never part of the actual build.

### Fixed
- A version-string sync regression from earlier in this same release: `pubspec.yaml` bumped to 1.50.0 but `AppInfo.version` and the AndroidManifest app label were left at 1.49.2, so Settings' "Current version" and the in-app update checker's own version comparison were reading a stale value. Resynced all three.
- `installApk()` discarded the system installer's result entirely, so a failed install (most commonly "install unknown apps" not yet granted for this app — the expected first run) failed completely silently after a successful download. Now surfaces a message telling the user to grant the permission and retry.
- `flutter analyze` failing on 23 pre-existing info-level issues that had accumulated silently since analyze had never run in CI before this release — 17 fixed outright (deprecated `withOpacity`, missing `const`, unguarded `BuildContext` use across an `await`), 6 deliberately left as `DropdownButtonFormField.value` (each genuinely needs to stay reactive to external state) and suppressed with a documented `// ignore:`.
- Added `test/update_checker_test.dart` covering the update checker's version-string comparison.
